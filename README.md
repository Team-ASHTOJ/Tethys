Tethys: Conversational ARGO Float Data Explorer


Tethys is a conversational AI system that makes it easy to explore complex ARGO float data—traditionally challenging to work with—through natural language and interactive maps.

This project bridges the gap between vast oceanographic datasets and the researchers, students, and enthusiasts who want to query them without writing complex code. Ask a question in plain English, and Tethys will provide an answer, a summary, or a visualization on a map.
